We have identified Production and Storage as units that have the quality of being instantiated several times across an extended physical territory. This territory could be within the political boundaries of -potentially- any country. 

An appropriate business strategy, yet to be developed, would consider expanding the business operations to countries with strong economies and cultural affinity, such as the US and Europe. Argentina seems like a good place to start, but further research needs to be done on this subject.

Distribution Unit services solve the need to bring closer to customers whatever the production plants and the storage centres (or Warehouses) produce and store, respectively.
