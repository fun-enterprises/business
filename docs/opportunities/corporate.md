Nowadays companies are integrating digital technology into all areas of business, fundamentally changing their operations and ways to deliver value to customers. This process is know as [Digital Transformation (DX)](https://cio-wiki.org/wiki/Digital_Transformation_(DX))
 
More and more they are becoming [technology companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company) regardless of the original industry the were born into. But their increasing need to offer better digital experiences to customers attaches new challenges such as dealing with more complex technical environments and  development and testing methods that are itereative and make use of automation.

Products, services and their IT environments are interrelated in a very complex way, which is hard to understand and therefore hard to change.

The amount of qualified people with leadership and technical skill that would be required to make this companies succeed, is far below the demand for this roles.

Workers already employed in these organizations typically lack the set of skills required to make such a transformation. 

Even if talented people gets hired, complexity and challenges may be so big within the organization that it is common to see this talent quickly go away since the high demand of qualified job roles allow them to choose.

Therefore companies struggle to find the talent, and to retain it. 

One of the ways these companies seek to mitigate this reality is by creating a strong company identity and culture and to communicate it both internally and externally, serving two primarily purposes: to attract talent, and to embrace it and hold it. 

Communication plays a key role in  this. And the production of multimedia content is now more than ever an excellent means to communicate this company identity and help to build and grow the kind of culture that can make business succeed. 

The production of corporate videos for internal and external audiences can help leverage the communication strategy of the company. but tipically current efforts fail to solve efficiently one key problem: communicate with easy and simplicity complex matters. this is were we can help them and bring a solution.

We focus in the production of a series of assets that can be adapted to the reality of any company, to help them produce vide-content and broadcast it, in order to leverage quickly, easily and at a good price, the foundation of a video-based communication strategy.
