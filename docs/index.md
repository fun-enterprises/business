# Retail:
# Canales de venta
# Productos
# Logística

# Retail businesses can include grocery, drug, department and convenient stores. Service related businesses such as beauty salons and rental places are also considered retail businesses.

# Examples of specialty stores include retail businesses that sell books, women's lingerie, motorcycle parts, sporting goods, vitamins, coffee, cell phones, pet supplies or office supplies.


# Firms that offer online retail aspire to provide the same customer experience to users as they are likely to experience in physical shops. E-commerce, on the other hand, involves the buying of products and services from a seller online, not the brand itself.

# E-TAIL: A DEFINITION
# E-tailing is short for electronic retailing and refers to the specific activities related to selling retail products and services via the internet. The key words in this definition are “retail products and services.”

# ECOMMERCE: A DEFINITION
# Ecommerce refers to a broader set of activities that include but are not limited to: selling retail products on the Internet (e-tail), electronic financial services like online transfers or transactions, management of online supply chains, mobile commerce (mCommerce), digital marketing, data collection systems, and more.

# E-TAIL FOCUSES ON THE B2C SEGMENT
# E-tail, being electronic retail, tends to primarily focus on the business-to-consumer (B2C) segment. Ecommerce, on the other hand, encompasses B2C as well as business to business (B2B), consumer to consumer (C2C), direct to consumer (D2C), and consumer to business (C2B) markets. More recently, people increasingly also use the term e-retail or e-tail to talk about indirect ecommerce selling or distribution, meaning selling products through ecommerce channels that you don’t own.
